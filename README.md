Personal Website

Simple project written in vanilla HTML & CSS, with a snippet of JQuery, that hosts that my CV as well as giving some info about myself. It serves as a landing page for potential employers or anyone interested in the rest of my projects. If you find any bugs or have any design recommendations, don't hesitate to contact me.
