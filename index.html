                            through supporters' organizations. I've also recently made my intramural debut. I play like a horse on

                            I can. I watch nearly a hundred games a season, and probably spend too much time pondering hypothetical
                            fantasy league situations, but hey, I made the finals four years in a row! The game has completely
                            enthralled me, especially now, as offseasons become more and more like a soap opera performed by

                            I'm currently just over two years removed from my foray into German, thanks to the Rutgers-NB
                            Honors College's foreign language proficiency requirement. It seemed unnecessary at the time
                            given that I'm a C.S. student, but I couldn't be happier that I did it. I found a love for learning
                            languages, spent five months studying abroad in Germany, and am currently diving into German 
                            television and music to further my grasp of the language.

                            Although I didn't enjoy my three years of Spanish in high school at all, after my experience with
                            German I decided to pick it back up. I've forgotten most of what I learned, and haven't consistently
                            studied, but I plan on eventually becoming fluent in order to further embrace my Puerto Rican roots
                            and share that with my father.
